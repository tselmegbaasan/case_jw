## Robot controller 

This is my solution for the robot controller case at Jayway. 

1. Install dependencies (npm install) 
2. Test the application (npm test) 
3. Run the application (npm start) 

The application is written in Node (Typescript), and unit testing is provided with Mocha.js. 

I really enjoyed this case! I hope you'll like what you see! :)
